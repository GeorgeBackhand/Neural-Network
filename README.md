# Neural-Network
implementation supports training a 3 layer feed-forward neural network with backpropagation

Implemented: Node input calculation, Logistic Function, Mean Squared Error, Backpropagation, Weights

Can Change: Input layer size, hidden llayer size, output layer size, and learning rate are configurable.

-> Lines 6-10 in the Main.java class can be changed.

Note: For changing which binary you want lets say '1000' use the chart below for the correct index.
'1000' = 8

Binary Inputs For Use:

0: 0000  //0 = index, 0000 = binary
